# .emacs.d

### Fixes
- Error during redisplay: (eval (custom-modeline-github-vc)) signaled (wrong-type-argument stringp nil)

### New Things
- flycheck working with eastwood and yagni
- multiple-cursors
- rest-client
- look into helm-cider

### Tweaks
- get eshell to color git diff without breaking magit
  (`git config --global color.ui always` breaks it)
- info-bar at top instead of bottom of frame?
