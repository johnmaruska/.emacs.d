## TODO

Next: Setup dual-frames, one on laptop with journal, todo, eshell. The
other with dashboard

### New Things
- flycheck working with eastwood and yagni
- projectile
- multiple-cursors
- rest-client
- look into helm-cider
- look into Spotify modes

### Tweaks
- refactor new things from Chris to match my code
- find system-name for non GR computers
- get eshell to color git diff without breaking magit
  (`git config --global color.ui always` breaks it)
