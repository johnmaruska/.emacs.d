;;; package -- Summary:

;; any appearance related configurations or functions. "appearance" here means
;; fonts, colors, sizes, etc. Not things like enabling/disabling displays.

;;; Commentary:

;; Probably I'll have to duplicate a lot of this stuff across different
;; platforms to use the same "feel" configuration everywhere...

;;; Code:
